code - Expert Setter

A problem setter is called an expert if at least 50%50% of their problems are approved by Chef.
Munchy submitted XX problems for approval. If YY problems out of those were approved, find whether Munchy is an expert or not.

Input Format - 
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a two space-separated integers XX and YY - the number of problems submitted and the number of problems that were approved by Chef.

Output Format - 
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if Munchy is an expert. Otherwise, print NO.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.
