code - Bus Seat Numbering
There is a bus with 30 seats. The seats are numbered from 1 to 30, and the numbering is as depicted in this image.

As can be seen in the image, the bus is divided into two decks - The Lower deck, and the Upper deck, with 15 seats each. And some of the seats come as Single and some as Double. For example, Seats 1 and 2 are Double, whereas Seat 11 is a Single.

You will be given a Seat number, and your job is to classify it as one of these 4 types:

Lower Single
Lower Double
Upper Single
Upper Double
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input which contains a single integers N â€” the seat number.
