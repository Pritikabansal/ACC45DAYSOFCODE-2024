/*
Day - 11
code - Audible Range

Chef's dog binary hears frequencies starting from 6767 Hertz to 4500045000 Hertz (both inclusive).
If Chef's commands have a frequency of XX Hertz, find whether binary can hear them or not.

Input Format - 
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer XX - the frequency of Chef's commands in Hertz.

Output Format - 
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if binary can hear Chef's commands. Otherwise, print NO.

The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.
